# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

## Overview:-
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts residential house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The model is built with a Gradient Boosting Regressor, trained on carefully preprocessed numerical and categorical features to achieve strong predictive performance.
The project covers the complete ML lifecycle—data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, persistence, and deployment. A Streamlit web application is used to provide an interactive interface where users can input property details and receive a real-time price prediction.
